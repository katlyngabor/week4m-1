## App Idea

### Synopsis ###

Food safety is increasingly important to consumers of prepared food products. Not just regarding food-borne / vector-borne diseases, but also for those with sensitive food allergies and diets who are potentially put at risk by certain ingredients. My app would combine publicly available restaurant health inspections scores with a list of known food allergies to compile an overview of the potential risks associated with eating at a given restaurant in the Atlanta metropolitan area. This app would use geolocation to bring up nearby restaurants, and contain a profile section where the user can fill out information regarding their food allergies and other dietary preferences.
